        <h1>What was this tutorial about?</h1>
        <p>This is where the journey started, the first codecademy tutorial. This tutorial covered the
        basics of HTML such as the structure of a website, what head and body tags are, divs, links
        and how to embed images and videos.</p>
        
        <h1>Structure</h1>
        <p>The first part of the tutorial covered basic HTML structure.</p>
        <img src="/images/HTML-structure-image.png" />
        <p>The code must first declare that it is an HTML document with the <strong>"&lt;!DOCTYPE&gt;"</strong> tag,
        this tells the browser that it is HTML code and allows us to set the HTML version we are using.
        We then need to use <strong>"&lt;head&gt;"</strong> and <strong>"&lt;body&gt;"</strong> tags, the
        head tag is used for all information about the page such as titles, linking other documents
        like css and javascript documents and any meta information.</p>

        <h1>Links</h1>
        <p>I also learnt how to use the anchor element <strong>"&lt;a&gt;"</strong> which is used to
        create links. By using href inside the a tag, we can link to other locations be it internal
        or external to the site. We can also add <strong>"target"</strong> to the a tag which we can
        add _blank to which will open links in a new tab.</p>

        <h1>Embedding Media</h1>
        <p>Another part of the tutorial was embedding media such as images and videos, this is done
        through the use of <strong>"&lt;img&gt;"</strong> and <strong>"&lt;video&gt;"</strong> tags.
        The img tag was used to embed them images on this page</p>
