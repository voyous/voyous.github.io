        <h1>What did this tutorial cover?</h1>
        <p>This tutorial was all about HTML tables as well as the first dabble into CSS which I used
        to change the font size of the table. <br/> Tables are formatted with a table head, body and 
        footer through the <strong>"&lt;thead&gt;"</strong> <strong>"&lt;tbody&gt;"</strong> and 
        <strong>"&lt;tfoot&gt;"</strong> tags, these are all placed in a 
        <strong>"&lt;table&gt;"</strong> element. Tables then have <strong>"&lt;tr&gt;"</strong>
        elements which create rows in the table, each row can have columns created with the
        <strong>"&lt;td&gt;"</strong> tag which enables us to put data values into the table.</p>

        <h1>Table format</h1>
        <p>As with an HTML document, which has a head and a body, a table has a simlar structure
        with a head, a body and a footer. In the head of the table we place the rows that will
        appear at the top of the table, this is usually used for coloumn headings. The table body
        holds the bulk information of the table, this is where we would place most of our table's
        data. Lastly we have the footer which goes at the bottom of the table, this can be used to
        store information such as the sum of all the values in a particular column.</p>

        <h1>What is "rowspan" and "colspan"</h1>
        <p>Inside the <strong>"&lt;td&gt;"</strong> tag we can place a <strong>"rowspan"</strong>
        or <strong>"colspan"</strong> along with a value to make the data value span across X
        number of coloumns or rows.</p>

        <h1>The &lt;th&gt; tag</h1>
        <p>the <strong>"&lt;th&gt;"</strong> tag is used to create values in the table which will
        be headers in the table. In the th tag we can tell the website if we would like to have 
        this header be for the row or the column by using the <strong>"scope"</strong> attribute
        which we can give a value of row or col to set the header on the side of the table or the
        top of the table respectively.</p>
